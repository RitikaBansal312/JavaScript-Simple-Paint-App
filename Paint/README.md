# JavaScriptSimplePaintApp

App is written using Plain JavaScript & HTML - no third party libraries like KineticJS or jQuery is used.

# Module 1: 
1. Made a Simple Paint App using HTML5 Canvas Element that lets users draw Triangles on the canvas by clicking & dragging the mouse - like in Windows Paint App.
2. Size of Triangles depends on how much the user drags the mouse.
3. Automatically fill each Triangle with a different color.
4. Added a clear / reset button that clears the canvas.

# Module 2:
1. Added a feature to drag Triangles using Mouse.
2. If the mouse is being dragged on an existing Triangle, drag the same or else create a new one.
3. Double clicking on a Triangle deletes the same.
